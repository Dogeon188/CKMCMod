# CKFFMC Farming Mod

You can see [the CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ckfarm) for more info I guess.

The mod is for a school project, and this is also the very first mod I've ever made. So there should be a lot of bugs...

**~~Mod Menu~~ CKFFMC requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**

(Part of the current look. It's corn and rice, I'm quite proud of the rice texture.)
