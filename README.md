# CKFFMC Farming Mod

You can see [the CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ckfarm) for more info I guess.

The mod is for a school project, and this is also the very first mod I've ever made. So there should be a lot of bugs...

**~~Mod Menu~~ CKFFMC requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**

(The current look. Yep it's exactly like that, but just for now.)

So the textures or so will eventually be changed to something more normal, and we might add some features soon.

## Some words

So you might wonder, there are already a whole lot of mods having similar things, then what's the point making this
 mod? Actually idk either, but like it'd be great for a school programming project ngl.

Also feel free to leave your suggestions! (since I'm lack of creativity lol)

## Copyright Thingies

I might use some copyrighted textures or something. If I did, please contact me, and I'll fix that ASAP.
