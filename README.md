# CKFFMC Farming Mod

You can see [the CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ckfarm) for more info I guess.

The mod is for a school project, and this is also the very first mod I've ever made. So there should be a lot of bugs...

Mod Menu requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

(The current look. Yep it's just like that, but just for now.)

**NOTE: The mod is still under heavy(?) development!**

So the textures or so will eventually be changed to something more normal, and some features might be added soon.

## Features

### Crops
- Lettuce
- Sweet Potato
- Rice

## Some words

So you might wonder, there are already a whole lot of mods having similar things, then what's the point making this
 mod? Actually idk either, but like it'd be great for a school programming project ngl.

Also feel free to leave your suggestions! (since I'm lack of creativity lol)
 
## Copyright Thingies

I might use some copyrighted textures or something. If I did, please contact me, and I'll fix that ASAP.
